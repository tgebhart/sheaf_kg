# Knowledge Sheaves: A Sheaf-Theoretic Framework for Knowledge Graph Embedding

Models are written to be compatible with the
[Pykeen package](https://pykeen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Download BetaE data from [here](http://snap.stanford.edu/betae/KG_data.zip) and 
put it in the top-level directory, keeping the folder name `KG_data`. 

## Recreate Figures

To recreate the figures, first run each of `naive_experiments.py`, `se_experiments.py`, `transe_experiments.py`, 
`translational_experiments.py`, `translational_orthogonal_experiments.py`.
